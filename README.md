# Takari Smart Builder


The Takari Smart Builder is a replacement scheduling projects builds in a Maven multi-module build. 

Documentation for usage and more is available in the Takari TEAM documentation at http://takari.io/book/index.html

## Reference and History

The original implementation of the Smart Builder came from Travis Downs and Brian Toal at [Salesforce][1] based on ideas
from the paper [Static vs. Dynamic List-Scheduling Performance Comparison][2] . Takari subsequently added the metrics
persistence and critical path scheduling.
