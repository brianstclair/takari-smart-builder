# Takari Smart Builder

# Overview

The Takari Smart Builder is made from the fastest unicorns that exist. The primary difference between the standard multi-threaded scheduler in Maven and the Smart Builder scheduler is illustrated below.

The standard multi-threaded scheduler is dependency-depth based in that it builds everything at a given dependency-depth before continuing to the next level, while the Smart Builder scheduler is dependency-path based in that projects are aggressively built along a dependenty-path in topological order as upstream dependencies have been satisfied. 

## Installing

To use the Takari Smart Builder you must install it in Maven's `lib/ext` folder:

```
curl -O http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/takari/maven/takari-smart-builder/0.3.0/takari-smart-builder-0.3.0.jar

cp takari-smart-builder-0.3.0.jar $MAVEN_HOME/lib/ext
```

# Using

To use the Smart Builder invoke Maven like this:

```
mvn clean install --builder smart
```

# Reference and History

The original implementation of the Smart Builder came from Brian Toal at [Salesforce][1] based on ideas from the paper [Static vs. Dynamic List-Scheduling Performance Comparison][2]. Takari subsequently added the metrics persistence and critical path scheduling.
